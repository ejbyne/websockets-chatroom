# Chat Server (Node.js and Socket.io)

## Summary

As part of our introduction to Node.js in Week 7 at Makers Academy, we learnt how to use websockets with the Socket.io framework.

Our project was to build a real-time chat server for multiple users, which I worked on with my pairing partner [Alan Bridger](https://github.com/abridger). The final product has the following features:

- User can enter name
- Shows list of current users present
- Provides notification when a user enters or leaves the chatroom
- Provides notification when another user is typing
- Messages scroll upwards when they reach the bottom of the chat window

The live version of the website can be accessed [here](https://chatterbox-chat-server.herokuapp.com/).
